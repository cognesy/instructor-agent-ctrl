# OpenCode Bridge (Internal Module)

This directory contains the OpenCode bridge internals (`Application/*`, `Domain/*`).

Canonical documentation moved to package docs:

- `packages/agent-ctrl/docs/10-opencode-bridge.md`

For normal usage, prefer the unified facade:

- `Cognesy\AgentCtrl\AgentCtrl::openCode()`
